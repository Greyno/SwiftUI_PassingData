# SwiftUI_PassingData
This app demonstrates how to use EnvironmnetObjects to pass data among three views - a Main view, a Detail view and an Edit view. Changes to a row in the Main
view are made in the Edit view. These changes are reflected back in the Main view. All changes are saved in User Defaults.
